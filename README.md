<h3>What is Coroutine?</h3> -
coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive. 
Over 50% of professional developers who use coroutines have reported seeing increased productivity.
This topic describes how you can use Kotlin coroutines to address these problems,
enabling you to write cleaner and more concise app code.


<h3>• How can two distinct Android apps interact? </h3>

Intents: 
Apps can communicate with each other using intents. An app can send an intent to request an action from another app, such as opening a specific activity or sharing data. The receiving app can then handle the intent and respond accordingly.

Content Providers: 
Content providers allow apps to share data with each other. An app can define a content provider to make its data accessible to other apps. Other apps can then query or modify this data using content resolver methods.

Broadcasts: 
Apps can send broadcast messages to notify other apps of events or trigger actions. Apps can register to receive specific broadcasts using intent filters.

Bound Services: 
Apps can bind to a service provided by another app to interact with it. This allows for more complex and ongoing interactions between apps.

Shared Preferences: 
Apps can use shared preferences to store and retrieve small amounts of data in key-value pairs. If two apps use the same shared preferences file, they can share data through this mechanism.

File Sharing: 
Apps can share files with each other using file providers or by writing to a shared directory that both apps have access to.

It's important to note that some of these methods require permissions and may have security implications. Apps should use these methods responsibly and follow best practices for inter-app communication.

<h3>• Is it possible to run an Android app in multiple processes? </h3>

Yes, it is possible to run an Android app in multiple processes. This can be achieved by setting the android:process attribute in the <application> tag of the app's manifest file. By doing this, you can specify a different process name for components of your app, such as activities, services, or broadcast receivers, allowing them to run in separate processes.

However, it's important to note that running an app in multiple processes can have implications for performance and resource usage. Each additional process consumes memory and CPU resources, so it's generally recommended to use multiple processes only when necessary and to carefully consider the trade-offs involved.
